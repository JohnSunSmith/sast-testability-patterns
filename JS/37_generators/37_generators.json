    "definition": "Generator functions allow to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function which is not continuous. Therefore, once these functions are called, they do not initially execute their code, but return a **generator** which is an iterator ({ value: nextIndex, done: false }). The generator function executes until it reaches the _yield_ keyword. Yield values are computed by generator on demand (this increase efficiency).",
