[Return by reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.references.return.php) in PHP, when the variable will be referenced to the returned variable from a specific function. Returning by reference is useful when you want to use a function to find to which variable a reference should be bound. If there are more than one return in the function, the variable will be referenced for the first one.
