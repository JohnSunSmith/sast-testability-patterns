    "description": "Foreach is used by high level programming languages to iterate over arrays and objects.\n```php\n<?php\n$arr = array(1,2,3);\nforeach($arr as $value){\necho $value;\n}\n```\nIn this example, any change on the variable $value will not change on the array $arr. If we want to keep the changes we have to add a reference.\n```php\n<?php\n$arr = array(1,2,3);\nforeach($arr as &$value){\n...\n}\n```",
