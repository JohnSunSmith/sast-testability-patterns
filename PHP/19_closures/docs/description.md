[Closures or anonymous functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php) allow the creation of functions, that have no specific name. In PHP, a closure does not inherit the scope it was defined in. It rather encapsulates its scope and any variable that you want to access must be bind to the function manually.

Instance 2 targets the usage of [arrow functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php). In PHP the implementation of arrow function uses the closure class as well, they both have the same features. Except arrow functions capture variables from the parent scope by value automatically.
