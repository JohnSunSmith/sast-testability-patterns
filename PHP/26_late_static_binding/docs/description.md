In PHP the keyword `self` does not follow inheritance. For example if you have a method defined in parent class and call it from the child class `self` will not resolve to the child class. To address this, [late static binding](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php) introduces a new use for the `static` keyword. When using `static` it binds the function to the class where it is first used.
