In many object-oriented programming languages overloading provides the ability of having multiple methods with the same name but different quantities and types of arguments. In PHP however [Overloading](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php) describes the concept of dynamically creating properties and methods. This pattern targets the usage of property overloading for `__set()`. This method is run when data is written to inaccessible (protected or private) or non-existing properties.
