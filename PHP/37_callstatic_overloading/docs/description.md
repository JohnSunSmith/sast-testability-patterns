In many object-oriented programming languages overloading provides the ability of having multiple methods with the same name but different quantities and types of arguments. In PHP however [Overloading](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php) describes the concept of dynamically creating properties and methods. This pattern targets the usage of method overloading for `__callStatic()`. This method is triggered when invoking inaccessible methods in a static context.
