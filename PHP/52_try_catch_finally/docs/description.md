In PHP [Exceptions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php) are similar to other languages. An exception can be thrown and caught, try blocks indicate positions in code, where exceptions can occur. This pattern should target the try-catch-finally block. The `finally` block will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception has been thrown, and before normal execution resumes.
