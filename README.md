Testability Patterns (TPs) are problematic code instructions that affect the capability of code analysis tools for security testing. Due to TPs, SAST tools may not detect an existing vulnerability, or conversely, report a false alarm. 


**What is this repository?**
This repository includes catalogs of SAST testability patterns. Each catalog targets a specific programming language, and currently we support JavaScript, Java, and PhP.
