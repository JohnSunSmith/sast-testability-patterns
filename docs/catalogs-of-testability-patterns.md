# Catalogs of SAST Testability Patterns

Testability Patterns for SAST are organized in catalogs, one catalog for each targeted programming language.

These catalogs need to follow a precise file system structure so to be properly operated by the Testability Pattern Framework:

- each catalog is captured as a subfolder of the `.\testability_patterns` folder, e.g., `.\testability_patterns\PHP`
- each pattern in a catalog is captured as a sub-folder of the catalog folder, e.g., `.\testability_patterns\PHP\1_static_variables`
- each pattern is required to follow the guidelines described [here](./testability-patterns-structure.md)

To add patterns into a catalog follow the guidelines [here](./testability-patterns-adding.md).
